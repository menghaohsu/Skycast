# A Weather Forecast App

SkyCast is looking to leverage a weather API (https://developer.forecast.io) combined with a geolocation API (https://developers.google.com/maps) to allow users to retrieve current as well as historic data about any location that the users search.

## Requirement

● SkyCast would like their users to be able to enter in any location and retrieve current and useful information about the weather in that area, as well as a future forecast.

● Include charts for historic weather information about that area using any visualization library of your choice, allowing the user to see relevant information within a reasonable time period.

● Additionally, the team feels that allowing a user to track his or her search history would be a valuable addition, and would like to see a way of storing queries made by a specific user between browser sessions

## Style

Since the project is a prototype, SkyCast looks to you for integrating usable designs and best practices in terms of look and feel into your application. They will also be looking to do a walkthrough of your code with you to gauge how extensible your codebase can be.
